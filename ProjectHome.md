**Downloading**

Due to abuse, Google Code no longer permits new downloads.
The source code is still hosted here, but from now on downloads will be found at http://www.middleearthgames.com/soov.html.

**The latest version is 1.0.12, released on March 4, 2014.**

**Updating**
Version 1.0.12 now includes some better updating technology.
To spot new versions, the updater will visit the RSS feed http://www.middleearthgames.com/software/joverseer/feed.xml once a week.
If it finds a new version, then it will notify you, show you what's changed and ask if you want to update. If you do, then it will download and install it.
Updates are currently about 2MB instead of the 15MB for the full install.

JOverseer now **requires at least** java version 1.6 (confusingly also known as java 6). java 1.7 (java 7) is preferred.


**Running**

Windows users can now run **jOverseer.exe** which replaces the old batch file and automatically configures the java environment for joverseer.jar.
