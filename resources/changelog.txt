-------------

25/3/2007

	* Fixed a problem with nation names that contained accents ( e.g. Eothraim, Dunadain Rangers, etc) which was causing problems in parsing pdf data. Saved games are unfortunately not fixed, this change has an effect only on new games.

	  Now you can choose textured (the current graphics) or simple, which uses a single color to draw the hexes.

	* Improved the form that shows the progress when importing turns. When the process is finished, a message is shown explaining the kinds of errors that occurred (if any).
