         <h3>Special thanks to</h3>
         <ul>
         <li>Brad Brunet, who spent long hours testing JOverseer and offering feedback and ideas, and who is also helping
         to support it.</li>
         <li>Wade F. Buhr, Mark Jeffries, Scott Moyes, Adrian Sheridan, Jerry Soules, Jon Steer, Lynn Still, who 
         helped with testing, finding bugs and suffering through the various shortcomings of the first versions. Several of these
         guys also contributed very useful feedback and ideas for improvement. JOverseer would
         not be what it currently is without their contribution.</li>
         <li>Panayotis Mertikopoulos, Haris Nikokavouras, Manolis Perakis, who originally tested the program in alpha version.</li>

         <li>Edward Lane, who helped with some issues with the XML parsing.</li>
         <li>Jason Bennett (author of MEOW), for some tips on turn auto-submission.</li>
         <li>Clint Oldridge, for supporting the project and prodding other people to help.</li>
