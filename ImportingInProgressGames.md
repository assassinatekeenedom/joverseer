# Introduction #

Suppose your game is already well under way, and you have a dozen or more turns, organized in different folders. Do you have to go through the painful process of importing every single turn separately?

**No you don't!** You can use the Game -> Import Game Dir Tree option to quickly import all the turns.

# Details #

So, let's suppose you have a game under way with a lot of turns. Let's also suppose that your turns are organized in a way similar to the one shown below:

Simply pick the Import Game Dir Tree option from the Game menu, point it to the folder containing all your turns (g26 in the example above), and sit back as JOverseer proceeds to import all your turns.

# Turn Names #

JOverseer recognizes turn folders by their name. So you need to follow a certain format. Acceptable names for say turn 1 are:

  * t1
  * t01
  * t001
  * turn1
  * turn01
  * turn001
  * t 1
  * t 01
  * t 001
  * turn 1
  * turn 01
  * turn 001

and **all capitalization variations thereof**.
