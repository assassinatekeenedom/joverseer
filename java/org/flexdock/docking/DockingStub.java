	 * a <code>Dockable</code> instance within an application instance, persist the ID, and recall it
	 * in later application instances.  The ID should be unique within an appliation instance so that
	 * there are no collisions with other <code>Dockable</code> instances, but it should also be 
	 * consistent from JVM to JVM so that the association between a <code>Dockable</code> instance and
	 * its ID can be remembered from session to session.
	 * <br/>
	 * The framework performs indexing on the persistent ID.  Consequently, this method may 
	 * <b>not</b> return a <code>null</code> reference.
